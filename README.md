# Credit Risk Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to classify and predict the risk of loan default based on financial lending data. The dataset used includes various loan attributes such as loan size, interest rates, borrower income, and other financial indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset `lending_data.csv` includes the following columns:
- `loan_size`: The amount of the loan issued.
- `interest_rate`: The interest rate of the loan.
- `borrower_income`: The income level of the borrower.
- `debt_to_income`: The debt-to-income ratio.
- `num_of_accounts`: The number of borrower's accounts.
- `derogatory_marks`: Marks for any derogatory credit reports.
- `total_debt`: Total amount of debt the borrower has.
- `loan_status`: The target variable, indicating if the loan was defaulted (0 = no, 1 = yes).
